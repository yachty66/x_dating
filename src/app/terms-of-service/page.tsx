    <p>Welcome to DirectorySF. These Terms of Service (&quot;Terms&quot;) govern your access to and use of the services and the DirectorySF mobile application (&quot;App&quot;). Please read these Terms carefully, and contact us if you have any questions.</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>

    <h2>3. Your Content</h2>
    <p>The App allows you to post content, including photos, comments, and other materials. Anything that you post or otherwise make available on our App is referred to as &quot;User Content&quot;.

While we work to protect the security of your content and account, DirectorySF cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security measures. Please notify us immediately of any compromise or unauthorized use of your account.</p>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Links, Sites, and Services</h2>
    <p>Our App may contain links to third-party websites, advertisers, services, special offers, or other events or activities that are not owned or controlled by us. We do not endorse or assume any responsibility for any such third-party sites, information, materials, products, or services.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to the Terms</h2>
    <p>We may revise these Terms from time to time.
