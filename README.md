This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## plan

- [ ] remove the form (everyone gets accepted)
    - [ ] make signup via twitter
- [ ] make sure login is only possible via twitter account registration
- [ ] people only can see the page with all the people for dating if they provided their dating information
- [ ] only have filters for gender and location
    - [ ] standard filter is set to all 
- [ ] only have one section for all profiles (no today etc)
- [ ] add about me only in a profile
- [ ] take care of removing all unnecessary things
- [ ] make redesign into red 

## ideas

- [ ] in the signup progress the user has to provide information to themselves based on which a model is finetuned with. user can than click the chat with me button which is opening a chat window which is a model which is fine tuned on the user and both persons are added to the chat
